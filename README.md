My personal bash profile that I use for all my Mac systems, it's up here for archival and retrieval purposes and for anyone that may be interested in mac based shell profiles

The Archive folder is where I copy from the terminal my current bash_profile into the archive folder with the current date as an extension before making major changes to the profile
